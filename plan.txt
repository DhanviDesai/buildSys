Instead of generating a file with all java files in it, we can compile classes as we come across java files.
For example, while traversing we would come across DepTrial, we would try to compile that, but it needs Appmodule hence we would have to go and compile that class first.
The problem with this approach is that, we would have to understand the complexity of the project.
There should be better ways to do this.
